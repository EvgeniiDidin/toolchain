Major changes in 2015.06 release
--------------------------------

Build process:
- Added NPTL Support (--nptl/--no-nptl options of build-all.sh). NPTL is now
  default threading library for Linux uClibc toolchain.
- Major change in toolchain build process - unified source tree is not used
  anymore. Options --unisrc/--no-unisrc removed.
- Added custom "configuration" files, that contain branches to be checked out.
  Option --checkout-config added.
- Added --host option to build-all.sh that allows to choose runtime host of
  toolchain build. That allows to do a Canadian cross build without modifying
  build scripts.
- Linux is now configured out of source tree.
- Error during PDF documentation build on RHEL 6
- Improve performance of branch checkout phase.
- It is now not required to copy `auto-host.h` file while doing Canadian
  cross-build for Windows - root bug in GCC has been fixed.
- Removed support for the old style uClibc "full" configurations, only defconfig
  is supported now.
- Removed option `--force`.
- Changed default Linux branch from 3.13 to 3.18.
- Added a new "TCF" wrapper for GCC. Script `arc-elf32-tcf-gcc` accepts `--tcf`
  option with path to TCF file, from which GCC options will be automatically
  extracted. Compatible TCF file is required (compatible TCF file have
  "gcc_compiler" section).

Release process:
- Extracted push-release.sh script from tag-release.sh.
- Makefile.release now automatically builds Linux IDE release tarball.
- Windows installer build script now automatically installs ARC plugins to
  vanilla Eclipse and creates installers after that.
- Changed naming convention of release tarballs to ensure consistent naming
  across different products: arc_gnu_{release}_{product}[_{os}_install].
- Automated process of OpenOCD building for release.
- Components in Windows installer can now be installed separately.

DejaGNU boards:
- Added DejaGNU board for OpenOCD.
- Fix numerous issues with nSIM-GDB DejaGNU board
